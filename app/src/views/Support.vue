					<h2>It takes a lot of time to create and maintain an app</h2>
					<p>From conception to design and implementation (coding), it takes hundreds of hours to make a tool like this work, without counting server and domain maintenance costs. Your support will make this project possible in the long run, and you would be contributing to a good cause, helping other people improve their lives too.</p>

					<h2>Android & iOS ports, and new features</h2>
