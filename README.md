Choose and icon, a frame and assign a value.  
Each time you complete a habit you will earn coins.

  

### 2\. Check-in every day and track your progress

### 3\. Optionally, create rewards to motivate yourself

### It takes a lot of time to create and maintain an app

From conception to design and implementation (coding), it takes hundreds of hours to make a tool like this work, without counting server and domain maintenance costs. Your support will make this project possible in the long run, and you would be contributing to a good cause, helping other people improve their lives too.  
### Android & iOS ports, and new features

I plan to port this app to Android (Play Store) and iOS (App Store), as well as implementing new useful features. Your encouragement and/or financial support could contribute to this project moving forward.  
  
### This project is open source

It's still an ongoing project, but feel free to use the code for any wholesome purposes.
