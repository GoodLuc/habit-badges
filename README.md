# Habit Hero / Earn your badges

Improve yourself, track your progress and be proud.

I had the idea to translate a personal habit tracking system I use from pen and paper to web/mobile app.

I've used this method for years and it has proven effective in maintaining motivation. I use letter symbols that represent different habits that I wish to keep practicing. Every time I write down a letter for the day it feels like an accomplishment earned, and when you see them compound over time it gives you a feeling of pride.

I was also inspired by other habit tracking apps such as "HabitRPG" and by skill badge earning systems as seen in the Boy Scouts or The Art of Manliness' Strenuous Life program.

My idea is to overhaul this system by implementing gamification principles such as rewards and leveling.

Right now the app allows you to create custom habit badges, connecting to The Noun Project's icon API. It's developed in Vue.js with MongoDB. It's fully functional and at approximately 70% completion.
